# genomics
A program for genome assembly/sequencing and genome rearrangements.
Functions combined to create an interactive program.

This program takes in user input commands. It first asks for a data input,
 either in-console or through a file, to convert DNA strings into the user's preferred output.

Currently supports:
- nucleotide counting
- DNA to RNA transcribing
- reverse complement
- pattern counting
- finding the most frequent patterns in a string
- FASTA-file conversion
- finding the GC-content of a string

Will eventually support:
- adjacency list of a FASTA-file string collection
- genome assembly of short super-string
- finding frequent KMers (patterns) with mismatches
- error correction in Reads
- constructing De Bruijn Graph
- genome assembly with perfect coverage
- genome assembly using reads
- genome assembly with perfect coverage and repeats
- assessing assembly quality (N50 and N75)
- inferring mRNA from protein
- counting point mutations
- partial permutations (rearrangements)
- enumerating gene orders
- longest increasing subsequence
- enumerating oriented gene orderings
- recurrence relations
- overlap graphs
- perfect matchings (RNA folding)
